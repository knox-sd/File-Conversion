File Conversion Program

I have attached a python script where it has a main menu where users can choose what file type are converted. I defined all the necessary function and structure, just need someone to fill out the logic. The file type I am working with is doc, docx, xlsx, xls, vsd, rt, html, pdf, ppt, pptx

I have convert.py in a folder with different file type.Not all file types can be converted to each other.I know you can look at existing script main menu to see what should be possible

For example if I had Computer programming.docx in  I want it to be able to convert to pdf and make a new pdf file in same folder that Computer programming.docx is in

The input should be folder location.
