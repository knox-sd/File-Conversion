<h1 align="center">File Conversion Program</h1>

<h2 align="left">I have attached a python script where it has a main menu where users can choose what file type are converted. I defined all the necessary function and structure, just need someone to fill out the logic. The file type I am working with is doc, docx, xlsx, xls, vsd, rt, html, pdf, ppt, pptx.</h2>

<h3 align = "left"> I have convert.py in a folder with different file type. Not all file types can be converted to each other. I know you can look at existing script main menu to see what should be possible for example if I had file.docx in I want it to be able to convert to pdf and make a new pdf file in same folder that file.docx is in the input should be folder location.</h3>
